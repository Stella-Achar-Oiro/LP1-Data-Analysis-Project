# Indian Startup Ecosystem Analysis
# Intro

## Project Intro and Objective
**Objective** - Our team is trying to venture into the Indian startup ecosystem. As the data experts of the team we are supposed to investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action.

## Business & Data Understanding
**How does Venture Capital Funding Work?** The process entails entrepreneurs pitching an idea to potential investors seeking finances (funding) to start/improve the business in various ways. A business plan is often a requirement for Venture Capitalist to assess the viability of the entrepreneur’s idea. **Invention** and **Innovation** are key concepts related to Venture Capital funding. Roughly 80% of funding goes into building infrastructure needed to grow the business. (Expenses `[manufacturing, sales, marketing]` and Balance Sheet `[working capital & assets]`).

Venture Capital Funding is short-term oriented - it is meant to grow the business to a point where it can be later sold off (to a Corporation or theough IPO). Sometimes the VC wants **equity** (a share of the business). Start-ups (esp. in the new information economy) lack hard assets and can’t therefore access funding from banks (require collateral)
**Large institutions** are often behind VC funds – insurance companies, pension funds, financial firms, universities. **Angel Investors** who are High net worth individuals are also participants. While screening ideas or after giving funding to businesses, Venture Capitalists can impose restrictions on behaviour of entrepreneurs.

While looking at the **The Indian Venture Capital context**,  we see a booming start-up ecosystem that has become one of the world’s most vibrant and innovative business environments. Country is increasingly being recognized as popular destinations for venture capital (VC) investments. Early-stage investments are seeing particularly strong growth in recent years while Domestic investors are still the most active investor group.

The are several stages of **Startup/Venture Capital Funding** - 
1. **Seed Funding** - the earliest stage of capital raising process as business hasn't started and is only an idea. It is considered the most risky and complicated as investor doesn’t have enough info to make a decision. Main participants are mostly Angel Investors (appreciate riskier ventures and expect high returns). Management/Soft skills of entrepreneur can determine business success (although modern Tech challenges this view).
2. **Series A Fianncing** - A type of equity-based financing (company offers convertible preferred shares). Consists of businesses that already generate revenues but are still in the pre-profit stage. Primary objective of funding is for continued growth. It follows a more formal process – more complete company info, valuation of company done & VC firm does due diligence (progress made since start, management’s efficiency in managing resources). Series A rounds raise approximately $2 million to $15 million and the median Series A funding 2021 = $10 million.

3. **Series B Financing** - this is the 3rd Stage Start-up financing and the 2nd stage VC financing. Like Series A, it is also equity based. The business is already in middle stages of growth, has a user base and could be generating profit. It is now looking to expand their market. More participants enter at  this stage as they are willing to invest in later stages of growth. The objective of funding here is to take business past development stage, help business scale or meet levels of demand. Most participants here are Venture Capital firms and private equity firms.
